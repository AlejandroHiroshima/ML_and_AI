       "'Netherland Dwarf rabbit\\nCountry of\\norigin\\n Netherlands\\nDistribution Worldwide\\nTraits\\nWeight 1.1–2.5 pounds (0.50–\\n1.13 kg)\\nCoat Short, Fine\\nLifespan 7-10 years\\nA Netherland Dwarf rabbit; note the\\nshort ears, brachycephalic head and\\ncobby body. Ruby-eyed white colour\\nvariety\\nNetherland Dwarf rabbit\\nThe Netherland Dwarf is a breed of domestic rabbit\\nthat originated in the Netherlands. Weighing 1.1–2.5\\npounds (0.50–1.13 kg),[1][2] the Netherland Dwarf is\\none of the smallest rabbit breeds. Its popularity as a pet\\nor show rabbit may stem from its neotenic appearance.\\nThe Netherland Dwarf is recognised by both the\\nAmerican Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA)[1] and\\nthe British Rabbit Council (BRC).[2] The Netherland\\nDwarf is often confused with the Polish breed of\\nrabbit, but the latter has longer ears, a non-\\nbrachycephalic head and less cobbiness. There are also\\ndifferent groups within the breed, such as: true dwarfs,\\nfalse dwarfs and a group with a nickname \"Peanuts\".\\nTrue dwarfs have one allele for dwarfism out of the\\ntwo which makes it smaller than a false dwarf, true\\ndwarfs are the ideal Netherland dwarf. False dwarfs\\nhave zero alleles for dwarfism out of the two which\\nmakes them larger than usual. Peanuts have two alleles\\nfor dwarfism, which can only happen if you breed two\\ntrue dwarfs together. This causes the rabbit to be\\nabnormally small and often die as in nearly all cases\\nthey can not drink their mother\\'s milk.\\nThe Netherland Dwarf breed was first produced in the\\nNetherlands in the early 20th century. Small Polish rabbits\\nwere bred with smaller wild rabbits;[3] after several generations\\nthe resulting animal was a very small domestic rabbit available\\nin a wide variety of colours and patterns. Netherland Dwarfs\\nwere first imported into the United Kingdom in 1948.[3] In the\\n1960s and 1970s the United States imported its first Netherland\\nDwarf rabbits. The breed was accepted by the American Rabbit\\nBreeders Association in 1969 using a modification of the\\nBritish standard.[3]\\nEarly dwarfs, even into the 1970s and 1980s, had fearful and sometimes aggressive temperaments. This\\nwas a result of breeders selecting wild breeding animals for their size. The first dwarf rabbits behaved\\nmore like these wild rabbits than domestic animals and were not good pets. However, through generations\\nof selective breeding, the modern Netherland Dwarf has become a gentle, friendly pet rabbit, though it\\nstill can retain a more energetic disposition than larger breeds.\\nHistory\\nAn adult Netherland Dwarf rabbit in Sable\\nPoint colour.\\n11-week-old Netherland Dwarf rabbit.\\n(Vienna Marked Black Otter)\\nYoung blue-eyed-white Netherland Dwarf\\neating timothy hay.\\nThe Netherland Dwarf\\'s head and eyes are disproportionately\\nlarge with respect to its short-coupled and stout (\"cobby\")[4]\\nbody. Its ears are notably short and carried high on the head\\nand its face is rounded and brachycephalic. These neotenic\\nfeatures, a result of dwarfism, cause the Netherland Dwarf to\\nretain an infantile appearance even into adulthood.\\nThe Netherland Dwarf has been bred in a wide variety of\\ncolours including: Ruby Eyed White, Blue Eyed White,\\nBlack, Blue, Chocolate, Lilac, Red, Siamese Sable, Siamese\\nSmoke, Sealpoint, Sable Point, Blue Point, Chocolate Point,\\nTortoiseshell, Agouti, Red Agouti, Opal, Cinnamon, Lynx,\\nChinchilla, Squirrel, Tan, Marten Sable, Marten Smoke,\\nBlack Otter, Blue Otter, Chocolate Otter, Lilac Otter, Fox,\\nOrange, Fawn, Hotot, Himalayan, Harlequin, Magpie,\\nBroken, Butterfly and Mantle EMD .\\nDue to their size and overall disposition, Netherlands Dwarfs\\noften do not make good pets for children although suitability\\nwill vary between individual rabbits. Small children, who\\nmay play with or pick up the rabbit to cuddle it, are generally\\nnot suited to the animal; dwarf rabbits do not like to be picked\\nup or held tightly, and may bite, scratch or struggle wildly if\\nthe child does so. This often leads to accidents if the child\\ndrops them out of fright, which can then lead to injuries due\\nto the fragile nature of rabbit bones. Larger breeds of rabbits\\nare instead recommended for children, because they have\\nfewer issues with temperament. However, it\\'s possible for\\ndwarf rabbits to learn to enjoy being held and cuddled, if\\nproperly trained as a baby with patience and care.\\nDwarf rabbits can make excellent pets for adults. They thrive\\nin a quiet, stable environment with plenty of human\\ninteraction. They are trainable, quiet and clean. Grooming\\nneeds are minimal, but rabbits will typically enjoy a daily\\nbrushing. Time is needed to bond with the rabbit and to build\\ntrust, because dwarf breeds are often more nervous and more\\naloof than larger breeds. However, when the rabbit has\\nbonded with their owner, they make affectionate pets.\\nAppearance\\nAs pets\\n1½ year old red-eyed-white (REW)\\nNetherland Dwarf.\\nA 7 year old Netherland Dwarf.\\nA grey Netherland Dwarf rabbit, 2 years\\nold\\nThe expected lifespan of domesticated Netherland Dwarfs is\\n7–10 years.[5]\\nNetherland Dwarf rabbits can be litter-trained, as they have a\\nnatural tendency to choose the same spot for their droppings,\\nand a much higher intelligence than most rabbits,[6] making it\\neasier to litter train them.\\nNetherland Dwarfs can be skittish, wild and/or of a\\ndisagreeable nature. This is a leftover stereotype from the\\nbeginnings of the breed. This has changed through selective\\nbreeding; however, they are skittish and aloof. They are\\nextremely active and energetic, requiring the same amount of\\nexercise as other breeds of rabbit. They also have a higher\\ntendency towards nervousness and stress. As with any\\nspecies, disposition will vary from individual to individual.\\nThe diet of a Netherlands Dwarf consists of an unlimited\\nsupply of hay, vegetables and good quality pellets. Root\\nvegetables and fruit, which are high in sugar, are not\\nconsidered suitable for forming a major part of the rabbit\\'s\\ndiet, and should be given sparingly in small quantities.\\nPellets should be fed in proportion to the adult rabbit\\'s body\\nweight, with 1/8 cup per pound of body weight\\nrecommended; juvenile rabbits, in contrast, are recommended\\nto be fed an unlimited quantity of pellets. Vegetables, in\\nparticular dark, leafy greens, are also recommended in\\nproportion to the rabbit\\'s body weight, at 2 cups or more per 6\\npounds of body weight.[7] Alfalfa pellets are recommended\\nfor juvenile animals, with pellets gradually replaced with\\nother hays and pellets as the rabbit ages, and food curtailed in\\nproportion to the rabbit\\'s weight.[8]\\nRabbit breeds derived from breeding larger rabbits with the\\nNetherland Dwarf (or any rabbit with a dwarf gene) are\\nknown as dwarf breeds. Most smaller breeds, like the Mini Rex, the Jersey Wooly, and the Holland Lop,\\nare results of such breedings. Generally dwarf breeds are slightly larger than the typical Netherland\\nBehaviour\\nDiet\\nDwarf breeds\\nA 10 years old Netherland Dwarf rabbit\\nyawning\\nA Netherland Dwarf rabbit on swing\\nDwarf, not growing larger than 4–5 lb (1.8–2.3 kg). Most\\nhave shortened faces compared to larger rabbits, and some\\neven preserve the rounded head, large eyes or small ears of\\nthe Netherland Dwarf. These features make them look little.\\nSpecifically, the Netherland Dwarf body should be round,\\ncompact and equally broad from front to back.\\nDwarf rabbits also have short legs and a large head in relation\\nto the body. Their foreheads are broad and they have well-\\ndeveloped muzzles. Furthermore, the eyes are large and\\nprominent. Their ears are erect and close together, reaching\\nbetween one and three inches in length. They have to be\\nshorter than 2.5 in (64 mm) per ARBA rules; if not, this is a\\ndisqualification from competition in the Netherland Dwarf\\nbreed. Dwarf rabbits typically weigh 2–2.5 lb (0.91–1.13 kg)\\naccording to ARBA.[9]\\nThe dwarf gene (symbol Dw) was discovered in the United\\nStates during the beginning of the 20th century. When two\\n\"true dwarfs\" (both buck and doe) are bred, the genetic\\npattern which makes them \"true dwarfs\" (Dwdw) ensures that\\n25 percentage of their offspring will inherit the lethal genetic\\ncombination dwdw. These offspring, often called \"peanuts\"\\nby rabbit breeders, fail to thrive and most die within 1–3 days\\nof birth. The reasons behind the lethal nature of the dwdw\\ncombination is unknown, but it is believed to cause\\nunderdeveloped digestive tracts in rabbits. The condition is\\n100% fatal, although if fed by hand every hour and kept\\nwarm, it is possible for a peanut to survive for up to three\\nweeks, even though it will be handicapped for its entire short\\nlife. Many ethical breeders humanely euthanise peanuts upon\\nfinding them soon after birth. Peanuts are easily distinguished\\nfrom non-peanuts; they have extremely pinched hindquarters,\\na bulbous head and their ears are often set further back than\\nnormal (sometimes almost onto the neck).\\nIf two true dwarfs are bred, the statistical result will be 25%\\nfatal 25% false, and 50% true. The actual numbers of\\ntrue/false/peanuts in a real litter varies. \"False Dwarfs\" tend to have longer bodies, longer/larger ears,\\nlonger faces, and are mostly heavier than the 2.5 lb (1.1 kg) maximum weight for showing. While false\\ndwarfs (referred to as BUDs by breeders, meaning \"big ugly doe\") do not make good show rabbits, does\\nfrom a good background are vital to a breeder\\'s programme. They have the same \"good genes\" as a true\\ndwarf and are capable mothers, possibly even having larger and more successful litters than true dwarfs.\\nFalse Dwarfs are also unable to produce peanuts. Their litters will be 50% false dwarfs and 50% true\\nBreeding\\nA 4-week-old Netherlands Dwarf rabbit.\\nAn adult female Netherland Dwarf, Black\\nSelf.\\ndwarfs if they are bred to a true dwarf buck. False dwarfs are\\neasily judged for quality as the traits are generally the same,\\nonly bigger. Ear thickness/shape, fullness of hindquarter,\\ntopline and other traits are the same.\\nIt is common practice among Netherland Dwarf breeders to\\nbreed a proven show quality true dwarf buck to a quality false\\ndwarf doe. This eliminates the chance of peanuts and yields\\nquality offspring. The chances of false dwarfs is higher, but\\nthose offspring generally go toward breeding (some false\\ndwarf bucks have proven themselves valuable to a breeding\\nprogramme) or are sold as pets.
